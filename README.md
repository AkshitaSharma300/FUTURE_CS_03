This project is a Secure File Sharing System developed as part of Task 3 for the Future Interns Cyber Security Internship. It uses Python Flask for the web interface and AES encryption
(CBC mode) via PyCryptodome to protect files during upload and download. The application demonstrates secure file handling, encryption at rest and in transit, and basic web app 
development. Users can upload files to be encrypted and later download them after decryption using a simple and clean interface.
